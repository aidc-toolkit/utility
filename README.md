⚠️ **This software is in beta**, with production release is scheduled for 2024Q4. To follow the status of that and other
projects, go to the AIDC Toolkit [projects](https://github.com/orgs/aidc-toolkit/projects) page.

The AIDC Toolkit `utility` package provides functionality that is not specific to AIDC but is nevertheless required by
other AIDC Toolkit packages:

- Number transformation
- String validation
- String creation

A comprehensive overview of this package may be found in the [AIDC Toolkit
documentation](https://aidc-toolkit.github.io).
